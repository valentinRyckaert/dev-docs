# Setup with Rails

The following guide is for installing TeSS natively on an Ubuntu-like OS. 
Some notes on installing under Mac OSX are also provided.

## Setup

Below is an example guide to help you set up TeSS in development mode. More comprehensive guides on installing
Ruby, Rails, RVM, bundler, postgres, etc. are available elsewhere.

## System Dependencies

TeSS requires the following system packages to be installed:

- PostgresQL
- ImageMagick
- A Java runtime
- A JavaScript runtime
- npm (and yarn)
- Redis

To install these under an Ubuntu-like OS using apt:
```shell
sudo apt-get install git postgresql libpq-dev imagemagick nodejs npm redis-server openjdk-11-jdk
```

For Mac OS X:
```shell
brew install postgresql && brew install imagemagick && brew install nodejs
```

And install the Java 11 JDK from Oracle or OpenJDK directly (it is needed for the Solr search functionality).

## TeSS Code

Clone the TeSS source code via git:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/ElixirTeSS/TeSS.git
cd TeSS
```
## RVM, Ruby, Gems

### RVM and Ruby

It is typically recommended to install Ruby with RVM. With RVM, you can specify the version of Ruby you want
installed. Full installation instructions for RVM are [available online](http://rvm.io/rvm/install/).

To install TeSS' current version of ruby and create a gemset, you can do something like the following:
```shell
rvm install `cat .ruby-version`
rvm use --create `cat .ruby-version`@`cat .ruby-gemset`
```

### Bundler

Bundler provides a consistent environment for Ruby projects by tracking and installing the exact gems and versions that are needed for your Ruby application.

To install it, you can do:
```shell
gem install bundler
```

Note that program 'gem' (a package management framework for Ruby called RubyGems) gets installed when you install RVM so you do not have to install it separately.

### Gems

Once you have Ruby, RVM and bundler installed, from the root folder of the app do:
```shell
bundle install
```

This will install Rails, as well as any other gem that the TeSS app needs as specified in Gemfile (located in the root folder of the TeSS app).

## JS

TeSS uses yarn to manage JS dependencies.

Install it using npm:
```shell
npm install --global yarn@1.22.22
```

and install JS dependencies using (from the app's root directory):
```shell
yarn install --frozen-lockfile
```

## PostgreSQL

Install postgres and add a postgres user called 'tess_user' for the use by the TeSS app (you can name the user any way you like).
Make sure tess_user is either the owner of the TeSS database (to be created in the next step), or is a superuser.
Otherwise, you may run into some issues when running and managing the TeSS app.

On Mac OS X, normally you'd start postgres with something like (passing the path to your database with -D):
```shell
pg_ctl -D ~/Postgresql/data/ start
```

### Create the database owner

From command prompt:
```shell
createuser --superuser tess_user
```

_(Note: You may need to run the above, and following commands as the `postgres` user: `sudo su - postgres`)_

### Set the database owner's password and permissions

Connect to your postgres database console as database admin 'postgres' (modify to suit your postgres database installation):
```shell
sudo -u postgres psql
```

Or from Mac OS X
```shell
sudo psql postgres
```

From the postgres console, set password for user 'tess_user':
```sql
postgres=# \password tess_user
```

_If your tess_user is not a superuser, make sure you grant it a privilege to create databases:_
```sql
postgres=# ALTER USER tess_user CREATEDB;
```

## Solr

TeSS uses Apache Solr to power its search and filtering system.

Double check you are using Java 11:
```shell
java -version
```

If not, you can switch using the following command:
```shell
sudo update-alternatives --config java
```

### Install

Run the following commands to download and install solr into /opt/, and have it run as a "service" that will start on boot.
```shell
cd /opt
sudo wget https://downloads.apache.org/lucene/solr/8.11.2/solr-8.11.2.tgz
sudo tar xzf solr-8.11.2.tgz solr-8.11.2/bin/install_solr_service.sh --strip-components=2
sudo bash ./install_solr_service.sh solr-8.11.2.tgz
```
### Starting/stopping solr

Make sure solr is started using:
```shell
sudo service solr start
```

If you need to stop it for whatever reason, run:
```shell
sudo service solr stop
```

By default, solr should be running at localhost:8983

### Create a "collection"

Next, create a collection for TeSS to use (assuming TeSS is checked out at `/home/tess/TeSS`):
```shell
sudo su - solr -c "/opt/solr/bin/solr create -c tess -d /home/tess/TeSS/solr/conf"
```

`tess` here is the collection name, which should match what is configured in your `config/sunspot.yml`.

### Re-indexing

If you ever need to re-index your TeSS data, for example if you have existing data in your TeSS database and are using 
a new collection, you can run the following command:
```shell
bundle exec rake tess:reindex
```

## Redis/Sidekiq

TeSS uses Redis to handle caching of various things (geocoding results etc.) as well as sidekiq jobs (asynchronous tasks).

Redis 6.2+ is required.

The following steps were taken from the official 
[Redis documentation](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/install-redis-on-linux/).
```shell
curl -fsSL https://packages.redis.io/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/redis-archive-keyring.gpg

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/redis-archive-keyring.gpg] https://packages.redis.io/deb $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/redis.list

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install redis
```
On macOS these can be installed and run as follows:
```shell
brew install redis
redis-server /usr/local/etc/redis.conf
```

And to run sidekiq to process async jobs:
```shell
bundle exec sidekiq
```

## The TeSS Application

From the app's root directory, create several config files by copying the example files.
```shell
cp config/tess.example.yml config/tess.yml
cp config/sunspot.example.yml config/sunspot.yml
cp config/secrets.example.yml config/secrets.yml
cp config/ingestion.example.yml config/ingestion.yml
```

Edit config/secrets.yml to configure the database name, user and password defined above.

Edit config/secrets.yml to configure the app's secret_key_base which you can generate with:
```shell
bundle exec rails secret
```

Create the databases:
```shell
bundle exec rake db:create:all
```

Create the database structure and load in seed data:

_Note: Ensure you have started Solr before running this command!_
```shell
bundle exec rake db:setup
```

Start the application:
```shell
bundle exec rails server
```

Access TeSS at:

<http://localhost:3000>

_(Optional) Run the test suite:_
```shell
bundle exec rake db:test:prepare
bundle exec rake test
```

### Setup Administrators

Once you have a local TeSS successfully running, you may want to setup administrative users. To do this register a new account in TeSS through the registration page.

Then go to the applications Rails console:
```shell
bundle exec rails c
```

Find the user and assign them the administrative role. This can be completed by running this (where myemail@domain.co is the email address you used to register with):

    2.2.6 :001 > User.find_by_email('myemail@domain.co').update(role: Role.find_by_name('admin'))
